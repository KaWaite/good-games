# Good Games

React app for video games. Currently can search games(limited in database) or see all games in database.

Plan: One stop site for video games. Sign in. Search. Review. Check length. Trophy count. Personal must Play List. Etc.

Using self made MongoDB database and currently only a handful of games. More to come as I add to the database. (Will revamp it!)

[X] Login/Signup  
[X] Sessions/Token(to remember user, etc)  
[ ] Add to user game list
[ ] Caching (to not make redundant api calls)  
[ ] rate limiting
[ ] Rate games, with average on gamecard
[ ] Time to beat
